Introduction:
Throughout history, there have been various wars. These wars have ranged in size from small too big with regards to the amount of military personnel. The geographic scope varied, e.g. a disagreement about a small piece of land, to vast parts of continents being disputed or trying to be unified. In wars, countries have either fought alone, or formed alliances, that is to say groups of countries standing together for a common cause or goal. The countries involved in a war form alliances with other countries within their respective country groups (e.g. Country A forms an alliance with Countries B, C and D, and Country E forms an alliance with Countries F, G and H). Each country in a country group has soldiers / armies / troops, and weapons. Countries within a specific country group order attacks against other countries within the opposing country group until only one sole superpower country group remains standing.
